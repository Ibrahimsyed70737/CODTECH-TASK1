##**Objective:**

To build a machine learning model that can classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.

**Key Activities:**

Data Loading: Load movie review data from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, converting to lowercase, removing punctuation and stopwords.
Feature Extraction: Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using accuracy and classification report.

**Technologies Used:**

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
String: For handling string operations.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as stopword removal.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks including TF-IDF vectorization, data splitting, model training, and evaluation.

**Overview:**

This script demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis of movie reviews. It starts by loading a dataset of movie reviews from a CSV file. Each review undergoes preprocessing to remove noise and standardize the text. The processed text is then transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. These features are used to train a logistic regression model, which is then evaluated on a separate test set to determine its accuracy and performance in classifying reviews as positive or negative.

**Output:**
